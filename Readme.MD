1. Project Overview
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Azure Synapse Analytics and PCA
Overview
In recent years, unauthorized use of credit cards, particularly in mail orders and online transactions where the physical card is not presented to the vendor, has surged globally. Without effective countermeasures, this trend poses significant risks and could lead to substantial financial losses for both credit card users and companies.

The Business Challenge
To combat unauthorized use, it is vital to accurately predict and detect fraudulent transactions based on transaction details. Quick identification of such unauthorized transactions has become a pressing concern for credit card companies and financial institutions.

These organizations must swiftly understand and analyze trends in fraudulent spending over time and assess the geographical characteristics of unauthorized use. Additionally, they need to develop concrete measures to prevent such activities.

Objectives and Goals
The project aims to utilize Azure Synapse Analytics' SQL On-Demand feature to transform credit card fraud detection and geographical data stored in CSV format within Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This transformation occurs without the need for extensive programming. Furthermore, the project demonstrates how to perform advanced data analysis using Power BI reports.

2. Understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in machine learning. It simplifies datasets by transforming the original variables into a set of uncorrelated components, each explaining a portion of the total variance.

Application of PCA in this Project
In this project, PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which comprises 28 principal components. The original features, including personal information such as names, store details, and products purchased, are excluded from the dataset to comply with GDPR and protect individual privacy. By retaining only the components that capture the most significant variance, PCA helps enhance the performance of the machine learning models by minimizing noise and reducing the risk of overfitting.
