# Azure Data Factory (ADF)

ADF stands for **Azure Data Factory**, a cloud-based **Data Integration** service by Microsoft. It is commonly used in **Data Migration** scenarios to move, transform, and orchestrate data from various sources to target destinations.

## How ADF is Used in Data Migration

### Step 1: Identify the Data Sources and Destination
- **Data Sources**: Identify where your data is currently stored (e.g., on-premises databases, cloud storage, APIs, etc.).
- **Destination**: Determine where the data needs to be migrated (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake, etc.).

### Step 2: Set Up Azure Data Factory
- Create an **Azure Data Factory instance** in the **Azure portal**.
- This will serve as the **orchestration tool** for your data migration.

### Step 3: Create Linked Services
- **Linked Services** act as connection strings to your data sources and destinations.

**Examples**:
- Create a linked service for your **on-premises SQL Server**.
- Create another linked service for your **Azure SQL Database**.

### Step 4: Define Datasets
- **Datasets** represent the **structure** of the data you are working with.

**Examples**:
- Define a dataset for the **source table** in your **on-premises SQL Server**.
- Define a dataset for the **target table** in your **Azure SQL Database**.

### Step 5: Create a Pipeline
- A **Pipeline** is a **logical grouping of activities** that perform the data migration.
- Add activities to the pipeline, such as:
  - **Copy Data Activity**: To move data from the source to the destination.
  - **Transformation Activities**: If data needs to be transformed (e.g., using **Azure Databricks** or **Mapping Data Flows**).

### Step 6: Configure the Copy Data Activity
- In the pipeline, configure the **Copy Data Activity**:
  - Set the **source dataset** (e.g., on-premises SQL Server table).
  - Set the **destination dataset** (e.g., Azure SQL Database table).
  - **Map the columns** between the source and destination if needed.

### Step 7: Schedule or Trigger the Pipeline
- Decide how the pipeline will run:
  - **On-demand**: Manually trigger the pipeline.
  - **Scheduled**: Set up a schedule (e.g., daily, hourly) for automated execution.
  - **Event-based**: Trigger the pipeline based on an event (e.g., a new file arriving in a storage account).

### Step 8: Monitor the Pipeline
- Use the **Monitoring** section in Azure Data Factory to **track the progress** of your data migration.
- Check for **errors, success rates, and performance metrics**.

### Step 9: Validate the Migrated Data
- After the pipeline runs, **verify** that the data has been successfully migrated to the destination.
- Ensure **data integrity and accuracy** by comparing source and target data.

### Step 10: Optimize and Scale
- If needed, **optimize** the pipeline for performance (e.g., **parallel execution, partitioning**).
- **Scale** Azure Data Factory resources to handle larger datasets or higher frequencies.

## Key Benefits of Using ADF for Data Migration
- **No-code/Low-code**: Easy to set up using a visual interface.
- **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with various data sources and destinations.
- **Monitoring**: Provides detailed logs and metrics for tracking.
